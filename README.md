# Pokémern

This is the Github repo for the Pokémern front end source code.
My goal for this project is to see how far the MERN (MongoDB, Express, REACT, Node.js) tech stack can
be pushed to make a Pokemon web app. The backend repo can be found [here]()

## Preliminary Implementation

The ultimate goal of the project is for the web app to be used as a to do list app for 
Pokemon who want to catch all the pokemon in their Pokedex.

For the time being the project will be constrained to the first 151 Pokémon but
will expand as popularity for the project evolves.

As a start users will be able to access pertinent info about the first 151
they are trying to catch, but eventually they will be able to log in and keep
track of all the Pokemon they have caught thus far.

### Feature Roadmap Round 1

- Pertinent Info about all of the first 151 Pokémon from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- A modal in which you can scroll through the Pokémon stats

### Feature Roadmap Round 2

- A search input that returns a Pokémon of interest.
- A filter that returns Pokémon of only a certain type.

### Feature Roadmap Round 3
- User authentication and login
- The ability to keep track of which Pokémon have been caught
- The ability to determine which shiny Pokémon you have caught
